# 🟡 Banture — DeFi Access for the Unconnected

**Banture** is a Web3 system designed to bring DeFi accessibility to underserved communities, beginning in Uganda, where the majority still rely on low-bandwidth feature phones and have limited access to the internet.

We aim to onboard everyday users into the world of on-chain finance using **USSD-based wallet access**, **SMS notifications**, and **MSISDN-linked custodial wallets**, while supporting full access via a modern web platform.

## 🌍 Vision

Billions of people across Africa and the developing world are excluded from Web3 due to:
- Limited smartphone or internet access
- Complex wallet UX (e.g., 42-character hex addresses)
- High gas fees and unintelligible transaction flows

**Banture bridges that gap** — delivering DeFi utility to *any* user, with *any* phone.
